        <h1>Privacy Policy Mobile App</h1>

        <p>
          This privacy policy is applicable to the Colors app (hereinafter
          referred to as "Application") for mobile devices, which was developed
          by Paul Ungerer (hereinafter referred to as "Service Provider") as a
          Free service. This service is provided "AS IS".
        </p>

        <h2>
          What information does the Application obtain and how is it used?
        </h2>

        <h3>User Provided Information</h3>

        <p>
          The Application acquires the information you supply when you download
          and register the Application. Registration with the Service Provider
          is not mandatory. However, bear in mind that you might not be able to
          utilize some of the features offered by the Application unless you
          register with them.
          <br />
          <br />
          If you choose to sign in using Google or Apple as your identity
          provider, the Application will securely store your name, email
          address, and login provider (Google or Apple) in order to manage your
          account. After signing in, a session token is saved on your device for
          authentication purposes only; this token is not used for tracking. No
          additional data from your Google or Apple account is accessed or
          stored beyond what is required for authentication and account
          management.
          <br />
          <br />
          The Service Provider may also use the information you provided to
          contact you from time to time to provide you with important
          information, required notices, and marketing promotions.
          <br />

          <br />
          <br />
          <span>{"\u2022"}</span> Usage data (such as which features are used
          most often, general device type, and time of use) is collected in an
