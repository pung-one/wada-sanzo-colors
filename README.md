# COLORS - The Dictionary of Color Combinations

## Description

This website offers an interactive adaptation of the book "A Dictionary of Color Comnbinations Vol. 1" which is based on Wada Sanzos famous color collection. The Website allows users to explore the List of 159 colors and 348 color combinations. On the detail pages of each color or palette the user has access to the **CMYK**, **RGB**, **HEX**, and **LAB** codes (Thanks to [Matt DesLauriers](https://github.com/mattdesl/dictionary-of-colour-combinations)). It is also possible to bookmark colors and palettes in a user-profile.

## Genesis

This website represents the graduation project of the Frontend-Coding-Bootcamp at Neue Fische coding school in Hamburg. I am happy to be able to implement my first own web development project as part of the boot camp.
